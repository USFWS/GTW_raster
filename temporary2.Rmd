<h2> Hands On: Import Line and Point Shapefiles</h2>

Using the steps above, import:
- West Virginia land cover raster *layer* (WV_habitat.img)
- NAIP color infrared photos as a raster *brick* 
- NCTC boundary (nctc_boundary) shapefile
- plot the `R`. Call the Harv_roads object `lines_HARV` and the HARVtower_UTM18N
`point_HARV`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of `R` spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent`for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?

## Hands On #? Solution
```{r import-point-line, eval=FALSE, results="hide" }
# import line shapefile
lines_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV",layer = "HARV_roads")
# import point shapefile
point_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV", layer="HARVtower_UTM18N")

# 1
class (lines_HARV)
class (point_HARV)

# 2
crs(lines_HARV)
extent(lines_HARV)
crs(point_HARV)
extent(point_HARV)

# 3 
#lines_HARV contains only lines and point_HARV contains only 1 point

# 4 -> numerous ways to find this; lines_HARV=13,
length(lines_HARV)  #easiest, but not previously taught
lines_HARV  #look at 'features'
attributes(lines_HARV)  #found in the $data section as above

# Alternative code for 1-4: view metadata/attributes all at once
lines_HARV
attributes(lines_HARV)

```

## Why use R as a GIS?

- Explore your data in all its dimensions
- Implement complex and custom made algorithms and functions
- Integrated analysis chain from download to analysis
- Automation
- combine spatial processing with subsequent analysis
- Make work reproducible
- promotes collaboration
- informs your future self
