This lecture will walk you through some basic R programming concepts needed to better understand its powerful syntax for data analysis and visualization. The focus of the lecture is ultimately the use of R as a GIS tool for basic I/O operations as well as visualization of spatial data. __*We acknowledge that the materials provided here do not by any means intend to be comprehensive nor attempt to cover all concepts that would otherwise require a semester-long course*__. The sections and code chunks found here are made of a mix of different internet and book resources. Because this repository is open-source, please feel free to use it as you deem appropriate and I would greatly appreciate any feedback to improve and build upon it. If you are familiar with version control concepts, such as Git and Github, you are more than welcome to 'fork' this repository on your own account and send a 'pull request' to me if you wish to add/edit any of the scripts.

#Basic R: quick refresheR 

This section goes through some basic R commands needed to work with spatial data.  The purpose is to provide a quick refresher so you can better follow the coming sections, where we dig into more advanced concepts of R as a GIS tool.

###Set Your Working Directory
Here, we'll use the `setwd` function to tell R where the module 1 folder is located on our machine. This will depend on the location of your downloaded course folder, Intro-Spatial-R.

```{r setwd}
# Modify the filepath based on your machine-specific folder location
# Single or double quotes work for text strings
# R requires pathnames to use forward slashes

# For today:
# setwd('D:/GTW_raster')
```

## About Raster Data
Raster or "gridded" data are saved on a regular grid which is rendered on a map
as pixels. Each pixel contains a value that represents an area on the Earth's 
surface.
