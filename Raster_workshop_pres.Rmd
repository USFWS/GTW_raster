## Overview

This module will take us through:

- use and benefits of R as a GIS tool
- basic I/O operations with raster (and vector)
- basic raster operations/conversions
- simple raster calculations
- raster &harr; vector conversion

## Overview

It assumes you know the basics about:

- working in R
- raster data

This material represents a conglomeration of original material as well as parts adapted from:

- NEON's [Data Carpentry lessons](http://data-lessons.github.io/NEON-R-Spatial-Raster/)
- Francesco Tonini's [Introduction to using R as a GIS](https://github.com/f-tonini/GIS610_SpatialR)
- Barry Rowlingson's [UseR 2012 Spatial Data Workshop](http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Teaching/UseR2012/)
- Robert Hijmans's [`raster` package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/raster.pdf)

This material is by no means comprehensive. 

The list above is a good place to start for more details.

## Raster data

- divides space in cells (pixels; rectangles) of equal size (for a given coordinate reference system)
- contrasts with discrete (vector) spatial data (points, lines, polygons)

## IMP development/assembly

- **Discussion**

    - *PRO*: IMPs ready for use; lower maintenance
    - *CON*: completing IMPs will take longer
    - Encouraging adherence to protocols?
    
<div class="notes">

- The adapted site-specific protocols in the IMP will be ready for use and posterity; plus, we won't have to go back and replace ISIs with site-specific protocols or, as I mentioned earlier, find similar ISIs among refuges and generalize up to a protocol framework
- The waiting is the hardest part; completing IMPs will take longer (for any given refuge) than under the current process but I suspect/expect that over a given time length (e.g., 7 years) more IMPs will be completed this way than under the current approach and they'll contain actual protocols that, hopefully, link to specific management objectives rather than ISIs 
- In my experience, just because you have a protocol doesn't mean a particular refuge is going to follow it.  How can we encourage adherence to protocols?  Withhold funding opportunities, similar to what was suggested for not turning in progress reports/data for funded projects?
